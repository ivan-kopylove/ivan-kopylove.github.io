How does MTU relates to capex and payload?\nХаб (не роутер) в сети для удобства можно рассматривать как шину, также как шина в factorio и вообще всё что является транспортом - чаще всего шина.\nШина - это bus. в англоязычной терминологии хорошо объясняет суть явления.\nИзначально это были повозки (omnibus - for all) - городской транспорт для всех желающих.\nАвтобус ходит регулярно не важно на то сколько в нём пассажиров. Накопилось 5 пассажиров из 50 - всё равно едем.\nХаб рассылает данные (бродкастит for all), а те кто способен их воспринять и после восприятия считает их нужными, то обрабатывает\nMTU - это история про пакетную отправку. Два противположных примера пакетной обработки:\n\nснижать накладные расходы на единицу полезной нагрузки. когда нужно дождаться всех, потому что операция дорогая. Пример - как щас китайцы летают в другие страны с жесткими дисками, или задача про перевоз данных в другой датацентр - быстрее всего на грузовике, хотя если что, то откатится вся транзакция целиком. Или самолёт - летает реже чем ходят автобусы, потому что накладные расходы очень высокие и нужно поднакопить пассажиров (это называется чартерный рейс), Именно для этого и делают овербукинг - даже ценой недовольных пассажиров при снятии с рейса когда мест нет выгоднее забивать самолёт целиком - потому что повышается CAPEX / payload. Пустым самолет редко отправляют, хотя если пассажиров не набирается, то всё-таки отправляют пустым. Ради одного пассажира самолёт полетит только обратным рейсом.\nкогда нужно быстрее доставлять пачки данных, при том что автобус не до конца заполнен. группировать пассажиров (payload) и набирать автобус из разношёрстной публики, потому что не всегда набирается полный автобус (я могу отправить 1 символ в мессенджере - это 4 байта, а MTU обычно 1400+ байт). Это как если бы учеников разных классов разделяли по мере того как они доходят до остановки и отправляли автобусами, а в конечном пункте обратно группировали обратно в свои классы.\n\nMTU - это размер автобуса (пакета). Заголовки - это карточка водителя, паспорт автобуса.\nТрафика обычно хватает, поэтому недостатка пассажиров не бывает, хотя если нужно послать 1 байт, то ради него всё равно поедет целый автобус (пакет данных).\nПакетная обработка применяется в Hibernate (там это называется batch) - суть такая же. SQL-транзакция дорогая, поэтому перед отправкой запросы группируются в пачку. Отправка по размеру или по таймауту.\n\nЕщё пример пакетной обработки - это когда нужно от железки получить какую-то информацию чтобы в софте были признаки для логики.\nЖелезку напряжнее обновлять, поэтому накапливаются требования и засылаются производителю, а он уже смотрит как лучше всё это сделать./\nЦикл внесения изменений в железо дольше чем в софт.\nЕщё пример применимости пакетных требований - это Clickhouse\nЭта база заточена под высокую производительность и данные в неё пишутся последовательно и в блоках данных не резервируют места для SQL UPDATE - он банально запрещен для последовательной схемы записи.\nПоэтому обновление схемы данных - дорогая операция и для неё хорошо бы подкопить побольше требований к новой SQL-схеме"},"heap/18b7":{"slug":"heap/18b7","filePath":"heap/18b7.md","title":"Hexagonal Architecturue","links":["CV/4bd6"],"tags":["garden-heap"],"content":"Ports and adapters\nHow Hexagonal Architecture connected to transitive table?\nWhat is driver / driven ports?\nCan adapters be used for internal purpose?\nHow HA is used in Voice Order?"},"heap/19ac":{"slug":"heap/19ac","filePath":"heap/19ac.md","title":"CAS","links":[],"tags":["garden-heap"],"content":""},"heap/2172":{"slug":"heap/2172","filePath":"heap/2172.md","title":"Fake it until you make it","links":[],"tags":["garden-heap"],"content":"What are the pros and cos of the approach?\npro\n\n\n                  \n                  Info\n                  \n                \n\n\nJust a physchological trick to stop procrastinating by pretending doing it.\nE.g. when I need to learn something, I open materials and start interacting with the materials.

BT-модулем могут пользоваться. Его нужно зарегистрировать в реестре BT-модулей, и тогда разные программы смогут использовать его для своих нужд.\nЕсть интерфейс сетевой карты.

Никаких портов физически не существует. Порт - это для удобства восприятия.

Там где нужно было сложение, делали сложение а других операций не было. Позже стало понятно что матетматические операции удобно сгруппировать в отдельный модуль, а другие модули будут просить CPU посчитать что-либо. Процессор делает одну вещь и делает её хорошо.\nВначале вычисления производили прямо на месте, и со временем догадались что можно вынести процессор в отдельный компонент, чтобы разные модули могли просить посчитать что-либо. Поэтому компьютер может существовать без процессора - просто каждый компонент нужнобудет научить самостоятельно считать для себя, т.е., CPU будет без буквы c. Или не будет универсальности - какому-то модулю нужно только сложение, поэтому он будет уметь только складывать. Появление процессора - это результат нормализации. Повторяющиеся операции вынесли в отдельную сущность, чтобы переиспользовать.\nМожет ли существовать компьютер без транзисторов?\nБытовой калькулятор - это компьютер?
